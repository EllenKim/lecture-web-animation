## So what is Sass and should I use it?
As soon as you're writing css comfortable, and you find yourself thinking, 'damn, I wish I could use variables!'. . start learning SASS. Until then, use please css.

- how to read scss/sass on codepen

Sass is a version of CSS with more robust features. You can write in sass and then transpile to CSS when it's time to view your code. Sass can be written in two languages - sass or scss (sassy css). I use scss! It's easier bc it's more similar to CSS.

### SASS workflow
- Make a file called `style.scss` and write your styling there, using scss
- In the header of your html link to a normal .css file: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">`
- When you're done with your SCSS styling or just want to see the status of your page, use terminal to transpile
- before you can transpile, you must install the sass transpiler: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/2016.3/transpiling-sass-less-and-scss-to-css.html#d253312e140
- in terminal `cd` into your directory and type $`





# Topics for next time:
- what about other browsers besides chrome?
- what about speed and performace issues css vs JS vs jQuery?
